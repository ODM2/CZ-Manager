Getting Started With CZ Manager
===============================

CZ Manager is designed for Data Managers and is intended for site level management of environmental data
stored in CZ Manager. It can be used for new or existing sites. It provides graphing and mapping
functions for time series and sample based data and is part of a larger suite of software developed to support ODM2.


What is ODM2?
-------------

Observation data model 2 (ODM2) is an information model for spatially-discrete, feature-based earth observations.
A broad array of different types of data can be stored in ODM2.

The ODM2 Software Ecosystem: https://github.com/ODM2/odm2-software-ecosystem

CZ Manager uses the ODM2 controlled vocabulary. The controlled vocabulary is designed to promote consistency between
different instances of ODM2 through a community moderated system for managing the master controlled vocabularies.
