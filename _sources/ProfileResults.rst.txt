Field area Palm SJH, WS 2015 represents a set of soil pits making up a study area. Soils taken from this study area were
analyzed for Acid phophatase, Ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and other compounds. A graph of these values can be
viewed here:

We can for example plot the percent clay content:
