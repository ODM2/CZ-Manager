.. _Managing-ODM2-With-The-Django-ORM:

The Django ORM and WOFpy
========================

While not all of the ODM2 entities are exposed through the ODM2 Admin interface all of the entities can be managed
using Python scripts using either ODM2PythonAPI or the Django ORM using the models in ODM2 Admin. Two examples using
the Django ORM come with the source code of ODM2 Admin.

The ODM2PythonAPI can be found here: https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2PythonAPI

An example merging data from a csv file to  fill a gap in a time series can be found here:
https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2-Admin/blob/master/example_scripts/SonadoraNitrateFill.py

An example creating soil profile result values from a file can be found here:
