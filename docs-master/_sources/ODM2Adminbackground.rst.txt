Why ODM2 Admin was developed
============================


ODM2 Admin is an application for site level data management of environmental observations using Observation Data Model 2
(ODM2). The application was designed for management of observations generated by the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory
(LCZO), an NSF funded Observatory established in 2009, located in northeastern Puerto Rico. The LCZO is one of NSF
funded nine critical zone observatories, it features a dynamic tropical rainforest, with a long history of scientific
inquiry and natural resource management. The LCZO manages in situ stream, groundwater, atmospheric, and soil sensors at
53 locations throughout the Luquillo Mountains. The LCZO also supports a number of field campaigns where samples of
soils, rocks, and water are taken and analyzed in a laboratory. The results of these analyzes inform LCZO researchers on
rates of weathering, sources and sinks of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, riparian zone dynamics among many other
subjects of inquiry.

Managing the diverse range of data and associated metadata generated from studies of the LCZO requires a robust
information model. To meet this requirement the LCZO adopted Observation data model 2 (ODM2) which serves as the
foundation of ODM2 Admin. ODM2 is designed to manage data generated from discreet earth observations across many
disciplines such as those made through the CZO program. Once the LCZO began using ODM2 it became clear, that due to the
many interrelated entities in ODM2, an interface was needed to more easily understand the information model. Creating
records in an ODM2 database requires associating entities through foreign keys and often those entities themselves are
related to additional entities. Keeping track of these relationships, using only a tool like SQL, is very difficult and
time consuming. As a result, the LCZO began developing ODM2 Admin to help manage data in this complex but robust
information model.

ODM2 Admin uses PostgreSQL, the Django web framework, and javascript APIs to create web forms for user friendly
representations of ODM2 entities and their relationships. The Django web framework has a python backend for
business logic and database interaction with html templates to generate the user interface. These technologies were
chosen to be open source and consistent with other software developed as part of the ODM2 software ecosystem
https://github.com/ODM2/odm2-software-ecosystem. These forms feature fields using drop down lists, type ahead fields and
related entities via inline forms. Many of the entities in ODM2 are meant to be managed via a community driven
controlled vocabulary. Such as system has been established here http://vocabulary.odm2.org/.  The ODM2 Admin web forms,
with links into the controlled vocabulary system, help facilitate understanding of the terms contained in the controlled
vocabulary. Time series and sample based results are mapped via leaflet and can be graphed via highcharts. Time series
data from sensors can be loaded via web form initiated Django commands or via the command line. Access to Django and
custom ODM2 Admin commands enable users to manage their ODM2 database and connect it with networked sensors.
