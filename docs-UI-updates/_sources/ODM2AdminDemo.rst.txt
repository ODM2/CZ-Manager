The recent actions block of the site administration dashboard shows changes you have recently completed in CZ Manager
such as adding or editing an item in the forms. In the example above we can see that a method, a data result and a
variable were recently changed.

The Authentication and Authorization link will allow you to create users and groups so others can login to the system.

The CZ Manager Administration link will take you to a list of all 44 ODM2 entities that can be directly managed in
CZ Manager. See the CZ Manager Forms for details about the CZ Manager Forms :ref:`ODM2-Administration`.

The recent actions section shows changes you have recently completed in CZ Manager such as adding or editing an item
in the forms. In the example above we can see that a method, a data result and a variable were recently changed.

The Authentication and Authorization link will allow you to create users and groups so others can login to the system.

Additional entities exist within the ODM2 information model these need to be managed with another tool
Such as with the ODM2PythonAPI. Django models exist for each ODM2 entity so it is also possible to write Python scripts
using the Django Object relational mapper. See :ref:`Managing-ODM2-With-The-Django-ORM` for details on using the Django
ORM with ODM2 databases.
